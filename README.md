## Todo app with React & Laravel (React frontend) (work in progress)
This repository contains the front end for a todo list app, written in React. 

In this project I use React and a variety of third-part libraries (e.g., React-Redux, React-Router) to deepen my understanding of the React ecosystem

The backend is built upon the Laravel framework: the db has been seeded with dummy users and "lorem-ipsum-like" data for demo purposes

You can access a working demo at: https://francescobellini92.github.io/Todo-React-Laravel-frontend/  with the following credentials:

1) user: witting.jana@example.net
   
2) password: test


## For cloning the repo
After cloning the repository, run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Running "npm start" will start the front end
