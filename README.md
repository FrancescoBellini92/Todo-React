## Todo app with React & Laravel (React frontend) 
This repository contains the front end for a todo list app, written in React.

In this project I use React and a variety of third-part libraries (e.g., React-Redux, React-Router) to deepen my understanding of the React ecosystem

## For cloning the repo
After cloning the repository, run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Running "npm start" will start the front end
