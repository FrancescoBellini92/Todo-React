For demo purposes, the db in the backend has been seeded with fake users and dummy "lorem-ipsum-like-data"

A live demo is available at https://todo-app--react.herokuapp.com/login with the following credentials:

1) username: witting.jana@example.net
   
2) password: test

## For cloning the repo
After cloning the repository, run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Running "npm start" will start the front end
