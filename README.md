## Todo app with React & Laravel (React frontend) (work in progress)
This repository contains the front end for a todo list app, written in React. 

In this project I use React and a variety of third-part libraries (e.g., React-Redux, React-Router) to deepen my understanding of the React ecosystem

For demo purposes, the db in the backend has been seeded with fake users and dummy data

A live demo is available at https://todo-app--react.herokuapp.com/ with the following credentials:

1) username: witting.jana@example.net
   
2) password: test

## For cloning the repo
After cloning the repository, run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Running "npm start" will start the front end
